					<h4>Before the Multi-Mountain Season Pass</h4>
					<p>SYRACUSE, NY - Before 2015, when consumers wanted to ski, they would simply buy lift tickets at the window. However, now window lift ticket prices have gone up to over $200 a day at some popular mountains. This surge in prices has led to the creation of the Epic Pass and the Ikon Pass. Season passes used to cost anywhere from $1,500 to $2,500, but now with the creation of the Epic and Ikon Passes, a season pass costs around $900.</p>
					<p class="indent">Christopher Steiner, a journalist from the New York Times, writes, ”Skiing is now part of the subscription economy, and being tactical about a multi-resort pass can reduce costs and put skiers on the snow for more days among fewer people.”  Except avid skier, Stephanie Schulman, says that the slopes are becoming even more crowded due to theses cheaper season pass prices. 
					Schulman says, “With more people buying season passes, the mountains have become more crowded than ever before. Lift lines that used to take 5 min now range from 20 to 30.” 
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
					Even with this ongoing issue, skiers are forced to buy one of the season passes if they don’t want to spend an absurd amount of money to ski. Both the Ikon and Epic passes are different from the traditional season pass and provide access to multiple mountains across the country for approximately the same price. Previously, a traditional season pass only provided access to one resort. The Ikon and Epic Pass today provide access to over 45 resorts. With Vail Resorts constantly expanding and acquiring more ski mountains, Epic Pass reported a 67% increase in past sales compared to the prior year (New York Times). As a result, Altera Mountain Company formed and partnered with other ski resort owners from Powdr to Boyne Resorts to create the Ikon Pass, the Epic Pass’s first major competitor.

					<h3>Ikon vs Epic</h3>
					<p class="indent"> I compared both of these passes to see which pass covers a greater number of high quality mountains and to determine if it is worth the cost to buy the season pass. A “top” ski mountain is usually considered to be one that is large, receives a large amount of annual snowfall, and has new state of the art equipment. When deciding between the two major season passes, one important question a consumer will ask is which pass includes larger resorts. Based on a dataset from 2019, my findings showed that the Ikon Pass resorts had an average of 1937 skiable acres per resort while the Vail Resorts had an average of 2195 skiable acres per resort.</p>

					<p class="indent">Another valuable question to consider is which pass covers resorts that tend to receive greater average snowfall. My findings also showed that Vail Resorts received an annual average of 259 inches while Ikon Resorts received an annual average of 315 inches of snow. Other factors also should be considered such as which pass covers more resorts that are closer to your home.</p>

		<p class= "margin" class="indent"> Clearly, the answer to this question varies for each consumer. Most passholders I spoke to either buy the pass that includes their home and local mountain while others change each year depending on what destination they would like to travel to in that upcoming season.</p>

					<h3>"The Ikon Base Pass" vs "The Epic Local Pass"</h3>
					<p class="indent">Both passes also offer a cheaper pass option for those not looking to spend as much called the “Ikon Base Pass” and “Epic Local Pass” respectively. However, both of these two passes do not compare to the full blown passes as there is one clear winner. This is because, with the exception of 5 resorts, all of the resorts have holiday blackout dates when on the Epic Local Pass there are many more resorts. For example, if one wanted to ski Christmas week, Martin Luther King weekend, and/or President weekend the Ikon Base Pass would not be the correct choice for that skier. The rationale for creating this pass is to encourage people to buy their lift tickets in advance. The Epic and Ikon Pass go on sale every March and stay on sale till early December with pass prices increasing every couple of months.</p>
					<p>Vail and Altera are doing everything they can to try to get you to purchase your tickets before the season even begins. Recently, they began offering day passes that can be used any day of the season for $67 a day. Why this sudden change? Steven Elbaum has been skiing throughout his entire life. He says that it is just an easy way for the resorts to make more money. Because if one does not buy an Epic or Ikon Pass, they are required to spend a lot of money only to ski a couple of days a year. Very few good ski resorts are not on either of these passes and the data demonstrates it is a no brainer. </p>

        				<p>The data used in this project is majority complied from Sijia Lai's OnTheSnow’s dataset from Kaggle. However, because it was from Kaggle.com, over one month it was checked with the data on every resort’s page on <a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/" target="blank">OnTheSnow.com</a> . My findings also include live interviews with skier Stephanie Schulman  (conducted on December 8, 2021 via the phone) and Steven Elbaum (conducted on December 8, 2021 via the phone) with secondary sourcing from NY Time’s article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/travel/multi-mountain-pass.html" target="blank">“How to Ski Smarter in the Age of Multi-Mountain Passes,”</a> (written on November 16, 2021) which gives a different perspective on how the ski industry has changed.</p>
						<p> One limitation to this dataset is that the data only includes 332 ski resorts out of the 472 currently in operation in the United States. So, it is missing over 100 operating ski areas in the U.S that could add helpful data to the resorts not apart of the Ikon or Epic pass. However, all of the "top" ski resorts in the U.S. are included in this dataset. </p>
